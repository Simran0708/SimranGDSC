       <p>"Christmas is forever, not for just one day,<br>
        for loving, sharing, giving, are not to put away <br>
        like bells and lights and tinsel, in some box upon a shelf. <br>
        The good you do for others is good you do yourself" <br>

    <h2>Last one, since its Christmas!! </h2>
    <p>The smell of pine boughs fills the air, <br>
        Pretty silver bells tinkle everywhere. <br>
        Sparkling snow covers the ground, <br> 
        Christmas spirit is all around. <br>
